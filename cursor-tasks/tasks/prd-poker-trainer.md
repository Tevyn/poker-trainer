# Product Requirements Document: Poker Trainer Application

## Introduction/Overview

The Poker Trainer is a comprehensive web application designed to help poker players study and practice preflop ranges across various game situations. The application transforms an existing prototype into a production-ready, minimalist tool that maintains all core functionality while being optimized for both desktop and mobile use. The primary goal is to provide an effective, user-friendly platform for poker range study and practice that can be easily deployed and maintained.

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Range Training**: Provide access to all major preflop scenarios with accurate range data for study and practice
2. **Multi-Modal Learning**: Support different learning styles through study mode, testing mode, and hand practice
3. **Mobile-First Experience**: Deliver a fully responsive application optimized for both phone and desktop usage
4. **Easy Deployment**: Create a maintainable codebase that integrates seamlessly with Vercel-GitHub deployment
5. **Range Customization**: Allow users to create, edit, and manage custom ranges alongside default ranges
6. **Progress Tracking**: Provide immediate feedback and accuracy tracking for practice sessions

## User Stories

**As a poker player, I want to:**
- Study preflop ranges in an intuitive visual format so I can memorize optimal play
- Test my knowledge of ranges through interactive practice so I can identify weak areas
- Practice with random hands across multiple scenarios so I can improve decision-making speed
- Switch between grid and pattern views so I can use my preferred visualization method
- Access the trainer on my phone during breaks so I can practice anywhere
- Create and edit custom ranges so I can adapt the tool to my specific needs
- See my practice accuracy in real-time so I can track improvement

**As a developer maintaining this application, I want to:**
- Have a clean, component-based React architecture that's easy to modify and extend
- Use the standard React + Vite stack that integrates seamlessly with Vercel deployment
- Maintain clear separation between components, hooks, and data management
- Leverage React's ecosystem and tooling for efficient development

## Functional Requirements

### Core Application Structure
1. The application must be a single-page React application built with Vite

### Settings and Configuration
29. The application must provide a simplified settings panel with view mode toggle only
30. The application must remember user's preferred view mode between sessions
31. The application must include range analysis tools (duplicate detection and removal)

### Data Persistence
32. The application must save all user preferences to localStorage
33. The application must save custom ranges and modifications to localStorage
34. The application must restore application state on page reload
35. The application must handle localStorage gracefully if unavailable

### User Experience
36. The application must provide smooth animations and transitions for mode switching
37. The application must show loading states and provide clear feedback for user actions
38. The application must handle edge cases gracefully (empty selections, invalid data)
39. The application must be accessible via keyboard navigation where applicable

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Postflop Training**: This version focuses exclusively on preflop scenarios
- **User Accounts**: No login, registration, or cloud sync functionality
- **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed progress tracking, historical data, or performance graphs
- **Multiplayer Features**: No sharing, collaboration, or social features
- **Complex Settings**: Beyond view mode toggle, no advanced configuration options
- **Data Import/Export**: No ability to import ranges from external sources or export data
- **Real-time Updates**: No live data updates or server-side functionality
- **Advanced Range Tools**: No equity calculators, solver integration, or advanced analysis
- **Theming**: Single dark theme only, no customization options

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with green accents (#4CAF50) for primary actions
- **Card Representation**: Realistic playing card styling with proper suit symbols and colors
- **Range Visualization**: Clear color coding (red=raise, green=call, gray=fold) with hover effects
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu with overlay for mobile devices
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Grid adjusts from 13x13 on desktop to smaller cells on mobile
- **Touch Interactions**: Optimized for touch input with appropriate button sizes
- **Viewport Handling**: Proper viewport meta tags and responsive breakpoints

### User Interface Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant controls based on current mode
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time visual feedback for all user interactions
- **Consistent Navigation**: Unified navigation patterns across all modes
- **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation for destructive actions

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **React Components**: Organize UI into reusable, maintainable React components using an established component library
- **Component Library**: Leverage existing component library for buttons, inputs, modals, and layout components to reduce custom development
- **State Management**: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for predictable state management
- **Component Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup and effect management for optimal performance
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features with Vite handling transpilation and bundling

### Deployment
- **Vite Build**: Optimized production builds with automatic code splitting and minification
- **Vercel Integration**: Zero-config deployment with automatic builds on git push
- **Static Generation**: Client-side React app compiled to static assets
- **Performance**: Vite's built-in optimizations for fast loading and caching

### Data Structure
- **Range Format**: Maintain the exact array-based range format from the prototype (raise/call arrays with fold implicit)
- **Category Organization**: Use the exact hierarchical category structure from the prototype's default ranges
- **Range Migration**: All range data must be migrated exactly as-is from the prototype's JavaScript data structure
- **Extensibility**: Design data structures to easily accommodate new ranges and categories while preserving existing format

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Target browsers that support React 18+ (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **Mobile Browsers**: Full compatibility with iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **Build Target**: Vite configured to transpile for broad browser support while maintaining modern features

## Open Questions

1. **Range Data Validation**: Should the application include validation to ensure range percentages are reasonable (e.g., not 100% of hands)?

2. **Practice Session Persistence**: Should the application remember incomplete practice sessions across page reloads?

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Beyond the current Enter/Space shortcuts in hand practice, are there other keyboard shortcuts that would improve efficiency?

4. **Range Import Format**: If future versions need range import, what format would be preferred (JSON, CSV, text)?

5. **Performance Optimization**: Are there specific performance requirements for the range rendering on lower-end mobile devices?

6. **Accessibility**: What level of screen reader and accessibility support is needed for this personal-use application?
