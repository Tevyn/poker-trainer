### Notes

- React components should use functional components with hooks
- Leverage component library components wherever possible to minimize custom CSS and development time
- All state management should use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- CSS should be modular and responsive-first, building on top of component library styles
- Use Vite's built-in development server for hot reload during development
- Deploy automatically to Vercel via GitHub integration
